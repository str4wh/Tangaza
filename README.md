🚀 TANGAZA – Helping SMEs Reach Customers Instantly
🌍 The Problem

In Kenya, most SMEs announce discounts through WhatsApp status, groups, or word of mouth.

Customers miss the message if they don’t check the status.

Groups are cluttered, and most people mute them.

Sending bulk messages manually takes time and effort.

This means SMEs lose money because customers don’t even know there’s a sale.

💡 The Solution: Promo Engine

Promo Engine is a smart messaging tool that helps SMEs instantly notify their customers about discounts and special offers — directly on WhatsApp, SMS, or Email.

Here’s how it works:

The SME logs into our app.

They write or describe their promotion.

An AI assistant rewrites it into a catchy, personalized message.

With one click, Promo Engine uses n8n automation to send the offer to every customer on their list.

Messages can include text, images, or even videos of the product.

🎯 Why It’s Unique

✅ Customers see the message directly in their inbox, not buried in a status update.
✅ SMEs use their own WhatsApp Business number, so customers trust it.
✅ AI makes every promo engaging — no more boring “20% off.”
✅ Multi-channel delivery → if WhatsApp fails, it goes by SMS or email.
✅ Simple dashboard → “Type once, send everywhere.”

🛠 Example

A boutique in Nairobi wants to push a weekend sale:

SME types: “Discount on dresses this weekend.”

Promo Engine AI transforms it to:

“💃 Hi Mary, this weekend only — get 20% off all dresses at our shop in town. Perfect styles for you. Limited stock, don’t miss out!”

With one click, it’s sent via WhatsApp (with a photo of the dress).

Customers engage immediately → more foot traffic, more sales.

📈 Market Potential

Kenya has 7.4M SMEs (source: KNBS).

Most use WhatsApp daily but lack tools to broadcast effectively.

Even if 5% adopt at KES 1,000/month, that’s a KES 370M/year opportunity.

💵 Revenue Model

Subscription (SaaS): KES 500–2,000/month based on number of customers/messages.

Pay-as-you-go credits for bulk campaigns.

🔮 The Vision

Promo Engine becomes the go-to marketing tool for African SMEs, helping them grow by making sure every discount, offer, or new product is seen by the right customer at the right time.
